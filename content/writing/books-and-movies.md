I've been enjoying watching movies and reading this vacation. I finished *Sans Soleil* and *His Girl Friday*, and re-watched *Seven Samurai* with commentary from Michael Jeck. And I finished Bloom's *The American Religion*, and started Stanis≈Çaw Lem's *Solaris*. Bloom's book is repetitive and asserts things with confidence without fully backing them up. But it started me down interesting lines of thought, and for me was an example of how to think of different denominations within a single frame, even if I disagree with how he thinks of them. He ends with some reflections on African-American religion, which he credits as the unacknowledged fount of modern Pentecostalism and one possible future for religion in the U.S. His references to the degree to which traditional African religion influenced African-American spirituality made me think of this podcast I have been following for a while, *History of Indian and Africana Philosophy*. The *Africana* episodes are co-written by Chike Jeffers and Peter Adamson, and specifically I was thinking of the most recent episode of E. Franklin Frazier, as well as the one on John Mbiti and his concept of time in the African religion.
