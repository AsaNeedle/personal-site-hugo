I just finished reading N.K. Jemisin's *The Fifth Season* and had blast. It's been a while since I've been immersed in a fiction book. Sometimes the writing and dialogue made my eyes roll, but that comes with the territory somewhat in YA/science fiction. It's the world-building and plotting that keeps you hooked. There's lots of interesting things going on with race and gender. There are trans characters, and the world of the *Fifth Season* is one where hierarchies based on racial phenotype coexist with hierarchies based on whether or not you can earth-bend. It's also a world with periodic near-extinction events, and information about how previous events were survived is passed down through lore (this aspect reminds me of the old Asimov short story *Nightfall*). In any case, there's such a playfull interplay between pseudo-scientic explanations and magical explanations, and a soft-magic system that strikes a nice balance between elaborating the world and not overexplaining. I'm looking forward to starting the next one, *The Obelisk Gate*. Using my Kobo e-reader again has been a God-send for making book reading as easy as web-surfing.

Questions:

What other science fiction books are out there that I don't know about but would want to read if I knew what they were about?

What does the concern with breeding and eugenics in Butler and Jemisin's work say about "the genetic" in the science ficiton imaginary?

Where can I find more contemporary fiction book recommendations?
