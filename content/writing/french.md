I thought today I'd write up my journey in learning French so far, with some notes at the end about where I want to go from here.

It started on a whim. My partner speaks French and I wanted to be able to surprise her by knowing a few basic phrases in French. I was also feeling burnt out on Spanish, which I had done in college, and had been picking up intermittently since then, never with much success. 

I started by listening to Language Exchange episodes on French. This is a gentle introduction to the language, focusing on transferring English vocabulary into French. There are about 40 episodes of around ten minutes each, so about seven hours of content in total. Then, I read a wonderful book called "English Grammar for Student of French" which does a wonderful job of teaching French grammar side-by-side with how the same concept shows up in English. By the time I had finished the book and the Language Transfer episodes I had caught the French-learning bug. 

My next step was to buy a set of Anki flashcards from a website called Speakada. There were 625 words of basic vocabulary that had 3 cards for each word: image to french word, french word to image, and french audio to spelling. I also started doing Pimsleur, which is an old language stand-by. I loved the listen-and-repeat format, even though it is in some ways less efficient than other ways of learning, because I could go on long walks around my neighborhood while doing it with my hands free. I preferred Pimsleur to other, newer listen-and-repeat courses for its no-nonsense brusqueness and minimal use of English, which is phased out as you advance. Finally, I bought a French basic grammar and workbook, with exercises and an answer key for self study, from the Practice Makes Perfect series. As it turned out, I finished the level one of Pimsleur (30 half-hour lessons), the workbook, and the Anki flashcard set at around the same time, which took about a month. I also scheduled four conversations with L1 French speakers through Italki, which remains an incredible resource for language learning. 

The other practice that I started around the time I finished the first round of studying was reading. The best book that I found for starting French reading was Marjane Satrapi's *Persepolis*. The language is basic and conversational, but the story is fantastic. Being a graphic novel, there are also a lot of cues to help you guess the meaning of the words, which obviates the need to look up every other word. The next book I started was the first Harry Potter book in French translation. I am a firm believer in the value of reading familiar books translated into the target language, against purist's who say that you should only read works originally in that language. The familiarity with the story makes for fantastic training wheels, without recourse to English. I finished the Harry Potter book at the end of June, about three months from when I had first started listening to the Language Exchange podcast. 

While reading, I continued with Pimsleur and continued onto Speakada's 2000 most common words Anki card deck. Those cards don't have pictures, but uses sentences to allow you to memorize words in a meaningful context.

I also found several resources that were less helpful. I was never able to fully take advantage of services like Tandem, which allow you to text L1 speakers of your target language, probably because I am lackadaisical about responding to texts in general. And I didn't make use of applications, for web or mobile, that try to be a one-stop shop for listening, speaking, reading, and writing in your target language (like Rocket French). For getting started with French, I went with a more *Ã  la carte* approach that I think, in this case, allowed me to make faster progress.

In the future, I'd love to challenge myself by signing up for a French level exam, like the DELF. If I do, I'll write a follow-up.

Resources:

Pimsleur French (the no-frills monthly app subscription is cheaper than buying the course. I don't think there's any benefit to owning the material, since the whole point is to progress past it as quickly as possible.)

*Basic  French* by Eliane Kurbegov, from the Practice Makes Perfect series 

*Persepolis* by Marjane Satrapi

Speakada Flashcards (These are expensive, but I feel it was worth it for me to be able to own the cards and have them in a software that I was comfortable using, namely Anki.)
