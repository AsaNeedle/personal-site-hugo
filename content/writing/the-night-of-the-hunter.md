Yesterday, I had a strong reaction to my Pfizer booster shot. It knocked me out for the entire day, but I was finally able to eat a banana and a few saltines by evening. I took the time to finish watching *The Night of the Hunter*, the noir classic directed by Charles Laughton (his only film as director) and starring Robert Mitchum as a charlatan priest and murderer. It reminded me forcefully of Bergman's *Fanny and Alexander*: both films feature a preacher who marries a single mother with two children, and is gradually revealed to be psychopathic. There is a religious scene in *The Night of the Hunter* where the mother, under the guidance of the priest/killer, confesses her sinfulness in front of an ecstatic audience, that reminded me of Bloom's conception of American Religion. Then I started watching Chris Marker's *Sans Soleil*, which has some really beautiful footage of 1970s Japan. The voice-over, narrated as a series of letters sent by Marker to a friend, can occasionally be racist, with references to "yellow men". There's wonderfully footage of and reflection on a Japanese labor protest. I can imagine it would be a great film to assign if you wanted to communicate what is meant by the "anthropological gaze". Marker seems interested in getting to the aesthetic essence of a foreign place, which is of course its aesthetic essence *for him*, not necessarily its residents. There is however a refreshing directness in the self-centeredness of the commentary.
