<p>My new year&rsquo;s resolution is to write every day. To that end, I&rsquo;m starting a curiosity journal, and for now housing it here on my personal site. What&rsquo;s a curiosity journal? Well, it&rsquo;s a practice I first encountered while taking a course called <em>The Ethics of Curiosity</em> with Perry Zurn (who as of last year has a <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/curiosity-and-power" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>book out</a> all about of curiosity). He told us to take notes on how curiosity showed up in our lives, which could include the feeling in ourselves, what it was directed towards, and even how we might see the word used in the wider world. It was a helpful practice that I didn&rsquo;t do as fully as I would have liked that semester. So now&rsquo;s my second chance!</p>
<p>I also love learning new things, and have always struggled with how to take the insular hobby of acquiring new bits of knowledge and make it more public or more shared. This past year has been one where I&rsquo;ve been able to devote time to learning practices. I taught myself a decent amount of French. I taught myself a good amount of trigonometry and formal logic. And I also got through almost 10 levels of WaniKani, the Kanji-memorization program. Setting the intention to continue with the lines of learning into the new year, I hope that writing about them, especially in a public way, will help clarify my thinking and allow me to better metabolize what I&rsquo;m learning as I go.</p>
<p>I hope this space will also double as a kind of reading blog, since my other intention for the new year is to read from a book every day. I was an intense little reader as a child and have somehow gotten off the habit as I get further away from college, more prone to being on my phone or podcasting. So here&rsquo;s to getting back on the horse and cracking a few more spines!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few of my ongoing learning projects in the areas of math and programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working my way through <em>Modern Logic</em> by Graeme Forbes (currently working on chapter 8)</li>
<li>Trigonometry and Calculus (currently on chapter 7 of I. M. Gelfand and M. Saul&rsquo;s <em>Trigonometry</em> and chapter 1 of Michael Spivak&rsquo;s <em>Calculus</em>)</li>
<li>The C Programming Language (using the classic K&amp;R text, currently on chapter 2)</li>
<li>Aspiration: Pick up Richard McElreath&rsquo;s <em>Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan</em></li>
</ul>
