      <description>I just finished reading N.K. Jemisin&amp;rsquo;s The Fifth Season and had blast. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve been immersed in a fiction book. Sometimes the writing and dialogue made my eyes roll, but that comes with the territory somewhat in YA/science fiction. It&amp;rsquo;s the world-building and plotting that keeps you hooked. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of interesting things going on with race and gender. There are trans characters, and the world of the Fifth Season is one where hierarchies based on racial phenotype coexist with hierarchies based on whether or not you can earth-bend.</description>

      <title>Starting a Curiosity Journal</title>

      <description>My new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution is to write every day. To that end, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a curiosity journal, and for now housing it here on my personal site. What&amp;rsquo;s a curiosity journal? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a practice I first encounted while taking a course called The Ethics of Curiosity with Perry Zurn (who as of last year has a book out all about of curiosity). He told us to take notes on how curiosity showed up in our lives, which could include the feeling in ourselves, what it was directed towards, and even how we might see the word used in the wider world.</description>
