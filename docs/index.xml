      <description>My new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution is to write every day. To that end, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a curiosity journal, and for now housing it here on my personal site. What&amp;rsquo;s a curiosity journal? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a practice I first encounted while taking a course called The Ethics of Curiosity with Perry Zurn (who as of last year has a book out all about of curiosity). He told us to take notes on how curiosity showed up in our lives, which could include the feeling in ourselves, what it was directed towards, and even how we might see the word used in the wider world.</description>
